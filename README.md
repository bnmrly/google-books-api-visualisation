# About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It fetches books by the author [J.G Ballard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard) from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/).

It uses [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2) to display the data by publication date, page count and category.

## Getting Started

Please run npm i to install dependencies and npm start to run the app.
